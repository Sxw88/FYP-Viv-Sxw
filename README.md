# FYP-Viv-Sxw

## Brief Description
In our capstone project (FYP), several swarm robots using Raspberry Pi controllers are programmed to demonstrate swarm behaviours.

## Deployment:
Clone the project's GitHub repository to /home/pi, and then in the project's root folder, there is an initialisation script `init.sh`. Run the initialisation script once to setup the project. Sudo privileges are needed to run the initialisation script, alongside with a stable Internet connection in order to download the required packages.
